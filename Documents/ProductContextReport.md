# Product Context

## Legal

The application we made is called DietCare. It focuses on physical health and food nutrition tracking and recommendations, aiding users in maintaining good health. We chose Python as our backend language, utilizing Python Qt5, Pandas, and other libraries, with SQLite3 as the mainstream database language.

DietCare utilizes several open-source software libraries, including Matplotlib, NumPy, Qt5, Pandas, and SQLite3. Matplotlib is distributed under the Matplotlib License, a permissive open-source license allowing free use, distribution, and modification. NumPy is distributed under the BSD License, which permits use, modification, and redistribution for almost any purpose, provided the copyright notice and permission notice are retained. This makes NumPy suitable for commercial and non-commercial projects, compatible with the MIT license adopted by our project. Pandas is freely available under its open-source licenses (Python Software Foundation License and BSD License, respectively). Qt5 is available under LGPL and commercial licenses. We have chosen the LGPL license to maintain the open-source nature of our software and adhere to relevant sharing and modification terms. SQLite3, as public domain software, offers a lightweight database solution for our applications without licensing restrictions. Our software is released under the MIT license, encouraging open use, contribution, and simplifying software redistribution.

## Ethical Statement

During the development process of DietCare, we strictly adhere to the ethical standards of the open-source community, ensuring all third-party libraries used are legally used in accordance with their licenses. We recognize the value of open-source projects and are committed to giving back to the community by reporting bugs, submitting improvements, and releasing our own open-source tools. Additionally, we ensure that our apps adhere to the highest ethical standards, protecting user privacy and data security when handling user data.

## Health and Safety Statement

We prioritize the health and safety of our users in the design and implementation of DietCare. While our software primarily deals with data visualization, we ensure all data processing is enclosed and secure in database files, taking measures to safeguard user data from unauthorized access. Furthermore, we encourage users to employ strong passwords and appropriate security measures to protect their personal information and data. We regularly update our software to address potential security vulnerabilities and ensure our applications provide a secure environment for all users.

## Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement

The DietCare team firmly believes that technology should be inclusive for everyone, irrespective of their background. Leveraging the powerful GUI features provided by Qt5, the application interface is user-friendly and supports accessibility features, such as high-contrast themes and text-to-speech functions for users with limited vision. We strive to make our software accessible and user-friendly for all users, utilizing simple, clear language in software documentation and the user interface. Additionally, we plan to add more languages in the future to ensure accessibility for all non-native English speakers. We are committed to creating an inclusive community that encourages and respects users and contributors from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
